# Identity

- [x] Create credentials without the need of a trusted third party. Create user asymmetric keypair
- [x] Create `.pem` file to save the private key
- [ ] Create a certificate 

## TIPS: Elliptic Curve Cryptography is applicable for:

- __Key Agreement__: It enables secure key exchange between parties, ensuring that the keys used for encryption and decryption are only known to the communicating parties.
- __Digital Signatures__: ECC can be used to create digital signatures, which are cryptographic proofs that a message was created by a known sender (authentication) and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
- __Pseudo-Random Generators__: ECC can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers, which are useful in various cryptographic applications.
- __Encryption__: Although ECC itself is not an encryption algorithm, it can be used in combination with symmetric encryption schemes to secure data.
